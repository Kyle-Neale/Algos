/***********************************************************************
Write a function `countScores(people)` that takes in an array of score
objects (people) as its input. A score object has two key-value pairs:
a name (string) and a score (number). `countScores(people)` should
return an object that has key-value pairs where each name is a key and
the value is their total score.

Example 1

var ppl = [ {name: "Anthony", score: 10},
            {name: "Fred", score : 10},
            {name: "Anthony", score: -8},
            {name: "Winnie", score: 12}];

var countPpl = countScores(ppl);
countPpl; //=> { Anthony: 2, Fred: 10, Winnie: 12 }

Example 2

var peeps = [
  {name: "Anthony", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2},
  {name: "Fred", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2},
  {name: "Fred", score: 2},
  {name: "Anthony", score: 2},
  {name: "Winnie", score: 2}
];
countScores(peeps); //=> { Anthony: 4, Fred: 4, Winnie: 6 }
